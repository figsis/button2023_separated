<p> In this task you will be making <b>six</b>
decisions about allocating resources between you and the Red Cross. All of your choices are completely <b>confidential</b>. </p>
  <p>Red Cross prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing
          the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.
          You can learn more about Red Cross
          <u><a href = "https://www.redcross.org.uk/" target="_blank">here</a></u>. </p>
    <p>For each of the following questions, please indicate the distribution you prefer most by marking the respective position along the midline. You can only make one mark for each question.</p>

    <p>Your decisions will yield money for both yourself and the Red Cross. In the example below, a person has chosen to distribute money
so that he/she receives <b>1&#8364</b>, while the Red Cross receives <b>0.50&#8364</b>.</p>    <br>
